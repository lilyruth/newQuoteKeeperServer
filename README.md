# Quote Keeper Server

This is the refactored backend of my Nucamp Honors project (https://github.com/lilyruth/pocket-quotes-server)

This version contains a new route (get a random quote) and a bearer token for authentication, finishing out what I did not get to at the time. 

The new front end will be done in React instead of React Native.
